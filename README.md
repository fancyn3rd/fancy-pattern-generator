It is based on [pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/).

**How it works:**
A few different shapes get repeated and overlayed with different blend modes.
All options get choosen randomly.

## Usage

Open index.html in the dist folder.

Hotkeys:

- G - Generate new pattern
- S - Save pattern to disk

## Development

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

You can change the pattern generation settings in config.js.
